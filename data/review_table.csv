Chrissie,Pinot Noir,Gouda,"This pairing is the best, man! I would literally marry this pairing. Honestly, I like Gouda with anything, so I would take anything I say with a grain of salt.",5
Nanien,Riesling,Gouda,I don't even like this.,0
Chrissie,Riesling,Gouda,"It may be because I’m super drunk, but this is the best thing I’ve ever tasted. It may also be because I reeeaaally like Gouda!",5
Maria,Riesling,Gouda,"I just tried dipping the Gouda into the Riesling. Was OK, but would not recommend (I may have done the pairing thing wrong tbh).",2
Merlino,Pinot Noir,Swiss,"Who the heck said that swiss would go well with Pinot Noir? If the swiss were parmesan, then I could get on board. But it’s not…",0
Sinon,Pinot Noir,Swiss,"I don’t know, man. I kinda like swiss and Pinot Noir. It’s like the Pinot takes away the bitterness of the swiss and leaves a subtle sweet aftertaste. I would eat it again.",4
Nanien,Sauvignon Blanc,Goat,"Yesss! Goats and berries, goats and berries!!! The pairing’s not bad either.",5
Merlino,Sauvignon Blanc,Asiago,"It felt like I was doing something dirty by trying to pair a French wine with an Italian cheese. It just seemed wrong, you know? But you know how sometimes when you do something wrong, it just feels right? Well this pairing felt right… in a wrong kinda way.",4
Chrissie,Sauvignon Blanc,Gouda,"Man... This Gouda. I don't even know, man. The wine is just OK. But the Gouda!!",5
Maria,Pinot Noir,Feta,"I knew not to dip the feta into the Pinot because it looked like the feta would just disintegrate into the wine, which seemed gross, so I ate them side by side. I don’t really know how I feel about it. The feta was tangy and dry, and the wine was kind of bitter. I don’t think they were very good together.",1
Sinon,Riesling,Brie,This one's pretty good. The acidity and sweetness of the Riesling pairs well with the softness and slight bitterness of the Brie.,5
Chrissie,Riesling,Colby,"I’ve had Riesling and Colby before, but not together, so I was pretty much going in blind – no expectations. And since I wasn’t expecting anything, I was surprised when I came out of the tasting with an actual experience. Was it a good experience? Sure. But I think the Colby could have used a little more Jack.",3
Nanien,Merlot,Brie,No.,0
Sinon,Merlot,Cheddar,"Merlot and cheddar is pretty good together, but I think a sharper cheese (or maybe just a sharper cheddar) would better complement the high tannins of the Merlot.",3
Nanien,Champagne,Colby,This is just plain bad.,0
Merlino,Champagne,Brie,"I had this with my girlfriend on New Year's. We felt pretty ritzy to say the least. From what I remember, the pairing was very good. The natural carbonation of the Champagne matched the soft Brie very well.",5
Maria,Pinot Noir,Gouda,My friend Chrissie told me to try this one. She said to take a sip of the Pinot Noir to first get the taste in my mouth. Then he said to eat a giant chunk of the Gouda. It basically just tasted like Gouda after that. Maybe that was the wrong way to actually test the pairing.,3
