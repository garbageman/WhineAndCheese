Create test cases and mockups for UI.


Javascript is split up into two types:
Services that are used by the page to get information. These scripts
are responsible for making ajax requests to our backend REST services.
Services should be designed to have unique functionality. What that means
is that there should be services for user information, possibly called
userService that will let the script user retrieve site user information.
This can then be imported by the page that needs anything about users
and allows for code reuse.

Controllers that manipulate the HTML document. Each page should import
the appropriate controller and whatever services are used. The controller
is responsible for using the services to get information that will be displayed
in the DOM.
